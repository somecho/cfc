# Soya - A Lightweight Creative Coding Framework in C

Soya is a OpenGL-based single-header library for creating 2D/3D graphics.

## Using Soya

Soya depends on the following libraries:
- [GLFW][glfw] for window management
- [Libepoxy][epoxy] for GL extension loading
- [Cglm][cglm] for vector and matrix math
- [libpng][libpng] for PNG import and export

## Running Examples
For now, if you would like to learn how to use Soya, have a look at the [examples][examples].
